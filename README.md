# RoboMayor
Twitter bot that acts like the town mayor

Scheduled to on a daily basis look at the past 5 tweets in its timeline, retweet and favorite them, and then create two
unique tweets each day based on a dictionary of terms mad libs style.

Activated by the phrase "will you please" which when tweeted at the RoboMayor will cause it to follow that user and respond
with a generic message.
